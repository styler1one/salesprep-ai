Generate a structured, factual summary with EXACTLY the following sections.
Do not analyse or interpret beyond what was explicitly said. Keep everything concise.

# Meeting Summary

## 📋 In One Sentence
A single precise sentence that captures what this meeting was about and its outcome or significance.  
Make it specific and grounded in what actually happened.

---

## 🎯 What Happened (3–5 sentences)
Provide a short narrative covering:
- The purpose and structure of the conversation
- The main topics discussed
- The tone, engagement level and overall dynamic
- Any shifts in clarity, interest or direction

Keep it crisp and factual.

---

## ✅ Agreements & Decisions
| What Was Agreed | Details |
|-----------------|---------|
[List explicit agreements or commitments only.]

If no agreements:  
**"No formal decisions – exploratory conversation."**

---

## ➡️ Next Steps
| Action | Owner | Timing |
|--------|-------|--------|
[List only clearly confirmed next steps with owners and timelines.]

If none were agreed:  
**"No specific next steps confirmed – follow-up required."**

---

## 💡 Noteworthy Moments
Highlight 2–3 moments that stood out:
- A revealing quote
- A moment of clarity, tension or enthusiasm
- A shift in priorities or focus

Keep these short and intriguing – use them as entry points for deeper analyses.

---

## 📊 At a Glance
| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Meeting Dynamic** | 🟢 Constructive / 🟡 Neutral / 🔴 Difficult |
| **Client Engagement** | High / Medium / Low – [one-line reason] |
| **Commercial Signals** | 🟢 Clear interest / 🟡 Mixed / 🔴 None / ⚪ Unclear |
| **Follow-Up Urgency** | 🔴 <24h / 🟡 This week / 🟢 Low – [reason] |

---

## 🔍 Explore Further
Recommend follow-up reports available in the system:

- **📄 Customer Report** – external-facing summary  
- **💰 Commercial Analysis** – deal strength, risks, buying signals  
- **📈 Sales Coaching** – behavioural performance feedback  
- **✅ Action Items** – complete task list  
- **📝 Internal Report** – CRM-ready update  
- **✉️ Share Email** – ready-to-send follow-up

---

RULES:
- Keep the entire summary under 400 words (excluding tables).
- Quote the client directly where valuable.
- Do not interpret beyond the transcript – label unclear elements as "Unclear from conversation".
- Prioritise clarity, brevity and momentum-relevant details.
- No fluff, no filler, no generic phrasing.
- Use a clean, senior-consultant tone.
- If multiple speakers are unclear, focus on the client's statements over the sales rep's.

IMPORTANT: Write the email from a CUSTOMER-CENTRIC PERSPECTIVE.

This means:
- Start by acknowledging THEIR situation, not "thank you for your time"
- Focus on what's relevant for THE CLIENT, not for you as seller
- Link next steps to CLIENT benefit ("This aligns with your goal to...")
- No sales language or internal jargon
- Professional but human and accessible

STRUCTURE:
1. Opening: acknowledge the conversation and their situation/challenge
2. Core: their priorities and how this aligns (not: what we sell)
3. Next step: concrete, linked to their goal
4. Closing: invitation to respond

AVOID:
- "Thank you for your time" as opening
- Too much emphasis on your products/services
- Long lists of features
- Jargon or abbreviations

Start directly with the email (no "Here is the email:" or similar intro).
Use [NAME] as placeholder for the recipient name.
